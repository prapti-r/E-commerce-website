# Cart Clearing After PayPal Payment - Bug Fix

## Problem Description

**Current Behavior:**
- User adds items to cart
- User clicks "Checkout with PayPal" 
- PayPal payment completes successfully
- User is redirected back to cart page
- **BUG**: Cart still shows the previously purchased items

**Expected Behavior:**
- After successful PayPal payment, cart should be empty
- User should see order confirmation page instead of cart page with items

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `Front_end_PHP/app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`:

1. The `successTransaction()` method processes PayPal payment completion
2. It creates order records in the database (ORDER1, ORDER_ITEM, ORDER_STATUS, PAYMENT)
3. **MISSING**: It never clears the cart items from the CART_PRODUCT table
4. **MISSING**: It never clears the session cart for guest users
5. **POOR UX**: It redirects back to cart page instead of order success page

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CheckoutController@successTransaction
**File**: `Front_end_PHP/app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`

**Added cart clearing logic**:
```php
// CRITICAL FIX: Clear the cart after successful order creation
$cartClearResult = DB::table('CART_PRODUCT')->where('CART_ID', $cart->cart_id)->delete();
Log::info('Cart cleared after successful payment', [
    'cart_id' => $cart->cart_id,
    'deleted_rows' => $cartClearResult,
    'order_id' => $orderId
]);

// Also clear session cart if it exists (for consistency)
if (session()->has('cart')) {
    session()->forget('cart');
    Log::info('Session cart cleared after successful payment', [
        'order_id' => $orderId,
        'user_id' => $userId
    ]);
}
```

**Added transaction safety**:
- Wrapped all database operations in `DB::beginTransaction()` and `DB::commit()`
- Added proper rollback on errors with `DB::rollBack()`

**Updated redirect**:
```php
// OLD: return redirect()->route('cart')->with('success', 'Payment successful!');
// NEW: 
return redirect()->route('order.success', ['order_id' => $orderId])
    ->with('success', 'Payment successful! Your order has been placed. Your cart has been cleared.');
```

### 2. Added Order Success Route
**File**: `Front_end_PHP/routes/web.php`

```php
Route::get('/order/success/{order_id}', [CheckoutController::class, 'orderSuccess'])->name('order.success');
```

### 3. Added Order Success Method
**File**: `Front_end_PHP/app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`

```php
public function orderSuccess($orderId)
{
    $order = DB::table('ORDER1')
        ->join('ORDER_STATUS', 'ORDER1.order_id', '=', 'ORDER_STATUS.order_id')
        ->leftJoin('COLLECTION_SLOT', 'ORDER1.slot_id', '=', 'COLLECTION_SLOT.slot_id')
        ->where('ORDER1.order_id', $orderId)
        ->select(
            'ORDER1.*',
            'ORDER_STATUS.status',
            'COLLECTION_SLOT.day as pickup_date',
            'COLLECTION_SLOT.time as pickup_time'
        )
        ->first();

    if (!$order) {
        return redirect()->route('home')->with('error', 'Order not found');
    }

    $orderItems = DB::table('ORDER_ITEM')
        ->join('PRODUCT', 'ORDER_ITEM.product_id', '=', 'PRODUCT.product_id')
        ->where('ORDER_ITEM.order_id', $orderId)
        ->select(
            'ORDER_ITEM.*',
            'PRODUCT.product_name',
            'PRODUCT.product_image'
        )
        ->get();

    return view('order-success', compact('order', 'orderItems'));
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Add products to cart
2. Go to cart page and verify items are there
3. Click "Checkout with PayPal"
4. Complete PayPal payment
5. **VERIFY**: You should be redirected to order success page
6. **VERIFY**: Navigate back to cart page - it should be empty

### Database Verification:
Before payment:
```sql
SELECT * FROM CART_PRODUCT WHERE cart_id = 'your_cart_id';
-- Should show cart items
```

After payment:
```sql
SELECT * FROM CART_PRODUCT WHERE cart_id = 'your_cart_id';
-- Should return no rows (empty)
```

## Affected User Types

### Authenticated Users (Database Cart)
- Cart stored in CART_PRODUCT table
- **Fixed**: Database cart is cleared after payment
- **Fixed**: Redirected to order success page

### Guest Users (Session Cart)
- Cart stored in PHP session
- **Fixed**: Session cart is cleared after payment  
- **Fixed**: Redirected to order success page

## Additional Improvements

1. **Transaction Safety**: All database operations are now wrapped in transactions
2. **Better Logging**: Added detailed logs for debugging cart clearing
3. **Error Handling**: Proper rollback on errors with user-friendly error messages
4. **User Experience**: Users now see order confirmation instead of confusing cart page

## Summary

The bug was caused by missing cart clearing logic in the `CheckoutController@successTransaction` method. The fix adds proper cart clearing for both database and session carts, improves error handling with database transactions, and enhances user experience by redirecting to an order confirmation page instead of back to the cart.

**Before**: Cart → PayPal → Cart (with items still there) ❌
**After**: Cart → PayPal → Order Success Page (cart cleared) ✅
