HOW TO RUN THE FRESH FRUITS SHOP SEEDER
========================================

Option 1: Run the specific seeder directly:
```
cd C:\Users\Abhidan\Desktop\Clexomart5.1\Front_end_PHP
php artisan db:seed --class=UpdatedFruitShopSeeder
```

Option 2: Run all seeders (including the fruit shop seeder):
```
cd C:\Users\Abhidan\Desktop\Clexomart5.1\Front_end_PHP
php artisan db:seed
```

If you encounter any errors:

1. Check that your database connection is working
2. Try refreshing the database schema first:
```
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
3. For unique constraint errors, the seeder has been updated to:
   - Use predefined order IDs (ord0004-ord0015) for consistency
   - Check for existing ORDER_STATUS entries before inserting
   - Use specific predefined ORDER_ITEM IDs matching the database
4. Then run the seeder again

The seeder will:
- Use existing trader user account (user0001)
- Use existing customer accounts (user0002 through user0016)
- Use existing category for products
- Use existing shop (shop0001)
- Create one cart for each customer user
- Add 10 fruit products
- Create order history spanning 6 months
- Add reviews for products

This will populate your analytics dashboard with meaningful data.
