## Trader Order Status Update Fix - 2025-05-22

### Issues Fixed
1. Fixed "Undefined array key 'ORDER_COUNT'" error in updateOrderStatus method
2. Fixed "Undefined array key 'STATUS'" error in checkOrderStatus method

### Changes Made
1. Modified VendorController::updateOrderStatus to handle case-insensitivity for Oracle's uppercase column names:
   ```php
   // Before
   if (!$result || $result['ORDER_COUNT'] < 1) {
       // Error handling
   }
   
   // After
   $orderCount = $result['order_count'] ?? $result['ORDER_COUNT'] ?? 0;
   
   if (!$result || $orderCount < 1) {
       // Error handling
   }
   ```

2. Modified VendorController::checkOrderStatus to handle case-insensitivity for Oracle's uppercase column names:
   ```php
   // Before
   return response()->json(['status' => strtolower($result['STATUS'])], 200);
   
   // After
   $status = $result['status'] ?? $result['STATUS'] ?? 'pending';
   
   return response()->json(['status' => strtolower($status)], 200);
   ```

3. Removed the duplicate route for TraderOrdersController@updateStatus that was pointing to a non-existent controller:
   ```php
   // Removed this line 
   Route::post('/trader/orders/update-status/{id}', 'App\Http\Controllers\TraderOrdersController@updateStatus')->name('trader.orders.updateStatus');
   ```

### Why These Changes Were Needed
Oracle databases typically return column names in uppercase, but the PHP code was trying to access them in lowercase. The solution implements case-insensitive column name access using the null coalescing operator (??) to check both uppercase and lowercase variants, making the code more robust for Oracle 11g database interactions.

These changes fix the errors that were occurring when trying to update order statuses in the trader order page, ensuring proper functionality of the order management system.

## Trader Dashboard UI Improvements - 2025-05-22

### Changes Made
1. Removed the top statistic cards from the trader dashboard:
   - Removed "Total Products" card
   - Removed "Total Sales" card
   - Removed "Active Orders" card
   - Removed "Customer Rating" card
   - Removed "Sales & Product Worth" chart and section

2. Renamed user interface elements for better clarity:
   - Changed sidebar menu item from "Dashboard" to "Shop Information" 
   - Changed page header from "Vendor Dashboard" to "Trader Dashboard"

3. Removed Chart.js dependency and associated JavaScript code for the Sales & Product Worth pie chart

### Why These Changes Were Made
These UI improvements streamline the trader dashboard interface, focusing on essential shop information rather than statistics. The renaming provides more consistent terminology throughout the application by using "Trader" instead of "Vendor". The removal of the analytics cards reduces duplication of information already available in the dedicated Sales Analytics section.

## Sales Trend Chart Optimization - 2025-05-25

### Changes Made
1. Improved the Monthly Sales Trend query in VendorController's analytics method:
   ```sql
   SELECT  TO_CHAR(cal.mth, 'MON YYYY', 'NLS_DATE_LANGUAGE=ENGLISH')  AS month_label,
           NVL(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 0)                   AS monthly_sales
   FROM   (
             SELECT ADD_MONTHS(TRUNC(SYSDATE,'MM'), -LEVEL + 1) AS mth
             FROM   dual
             CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 6
           ) cal
   LEFT   JOIN order1      o  ON TRUNC(o.order_date,'MM') = cal.mth
   LEFT   JOIN order_item  oi ON oi.order_id  = o.order_id
   LEFT   JOIN product     p  ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
   WHERE        p.shop_id  = :shop_id
   GROUP  BY    cal.mth
   ORDER  BY    cal.mth
   ```

2. Updated trader_analytics.blade.php to use the new field names:
   - Changed MONTH_DISPLAY to month_label
   - Changed MONTHLY_SALES to monthly_sales
   - Kept fallbacks for Oracle's case sensitivity

### Why These Changes Were Needed
The optimized query delivers several improvements:
- Shows consistent data for the last 6 months, including months with zero sales
- Uses more efficient date comparisons with TRUNC(o.order_date,'MM')
- Orders results chronologically for better chart presentation
- Improves readability with explicit aliases
- Ensures proper NLS settings with 'NLS_DATE_LANGUAGE=ENGLISH' parameter

These changes provide traders with a more accurate and consistent sales trend visualization, helping them better understand their sales patterns over time.

## Analytics Period Selection Feature - 2025-05-26

### Changes Made
1. Added period selection buttons (Today, This Week, This Month) to the trader analytics page:
   - Implemented buttons with AJAX functionality to update statistics without page reload
   - Added visual indicators for the active period
   - Added "All Time" tab for viewing aggregate statistics across the entire history
   - Added visual section divider to clearly separate dynamic period-based statistics from static analytics

2. Created SQL files with optimized queries for period-specific analytics:
   - period_stats.sql: Gets current period statistics using a single query with period parameter
   - period_stats_prev.sql: Gets previous period statistics for calculating change percentages
   - Added special handling for "All Time" statistics with optimized queries

3. Added a new controller method in VendorController:
   ```php
   public function analyticsByPeriod($period) // 'A','D','W','M'
   ```
   - Handles fetching analytics data for specific time periods
   - Returns JSON data with current statistics and percentage changes from previous periods
   - Ensures proper case-insensitive handling for Oracle's uppercase column names
   - Added support for 'A' (All Time) period type with appropriate queries

4. Enhanced the trader_analytics.blade.php template:
   - Added period selection buttons with "All Time" set as the default view
   - Added JavaScript to handle AJAX calls and dynamically update statistics
   - Added visual indicators for positive/negative changes
   - Implemented conditional display of change indicators (hidden for All Time view)
   - Added visual section divider to clearly separate dynamic period-based statistics from static analytics

### Why These Changes Were Needed
The period selection feature gives traders more granular insights into their sales performance across different timeframes. Instead of only seeing all-time statistics, they can now:
- View today's performance for immediate insights
- Analyze weekly trends for short-term planning
- Review monthly data for broader business decisions

The implementation uses a single, efficient SQL query with a period parameter, reducing database load while providing fast access to time-based analytics. The percentage change indicators help traders quickly identify performance trends relative to previous periods.

## RFID Integration for Product Management - 2025-05-27

2. Enhanced VendorController to manage RFID data:
   - Updated storeProduct method to store RFID UIDs in the RFID_PRODUCT table
   - Updated updateProduct method to update RFID UIDs for existing products
   - Added code to prevent duplicate RFID UIDs across products
   - Added RFID UID deletion when products are removed
   - Enhanced product edit form to display existing RFID UIDs

3. Updated product listing interface:
   - Added RFID UID column to the product list table
   - Enhanced product fetching to include associated RFID UIDs
   - Added "Not assigned" display for products without RFID tags

## RFID Case Sensitivity Fix - 2025-05-28

### Issues Fixed
- Fixed issue where RFID UIDs weren't appearing in the product list after updating a product

### Changes Made
- Modified the products method in VendorController to properly handle case sensitivity in RFID database queries:
  ```php
  // Before
  while ($row = $rfidStmt->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
      $rfidData[$row['PRODUCT_ID']] = $row['RFID'];
  }
  
  // After
  while ($row = $rfidStmt->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
      // Handle both uppercase and lowercase column names
      $productId = $row['PRODUCT_ID'] ?? $row['product_id'] ?? null;
      $rfid = $row['RFID'] ?? $row['rfid'] ?? null;
      
      if ($productId && $rfid) {
          $rfidData[$productId] = $rfid;
      }
  }
  ```

### Why These Changes Were Needed
Oracle databases return column names in uppercase, but some queries might return them in lowercase depending on how they were defined. This fix ensures the application handles both cases properly, making the RFID integration more robust when working with the Oracle database. After this fix, RFID UIDs now properly display in the product list after updates.

## RFID Implementation Update - 2025-05-29

### Changes Made
